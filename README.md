# javascript-katas
Code to accompany my JavaScript Katas talk.

##Conference Blurb##
If you have ever studied a martial art, chances are you are familiar with katas: the practice of individual training exercises. Repeatedly. It may seem pointless to practice the same move again and again, but the only way to improve is repetition. We can apply the same concept to learning programming languages.

Working individually or in small groups, attendees will work through a set of problems using JavaScript to solve them. Whether you are new to JavaScript or an old hand, this session will give you an opportunity to hone your craft! Bring a laptop or be prepared to make a friend.

##What We'll Cover##
The Goal is simple: delve into the practice of coding katas in the style of JavaScript.

##What We Won't Delve Into##
This isn't an intro to JavaScript class or a discussion of how to build a Node app.
